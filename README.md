Hi Guys..!

This is my first ever project and it depicts a simple **Clock App** with basic functionalities namely a Live clock, timer, stopwatch and alarm with sound.

Just download both files and make sure that both files are in the same directory. You can just run the program, and then it will run without any errors. The file is Jupyter Notebook-based and the enter program is built using Python modules like Tkinter,  Time and Pygame
